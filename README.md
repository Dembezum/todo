### Background
Creating this program as a school project. I've decided to program the first
version in C.

Due to my lack of programming knowledge and deep understanding of C code, my
abilities are limited to this pretty much. I have spent MANY horus writing this
project, and i have learn't an unfathomable amount of things, methods, and much
more. 

This inspires me to keep developing on this project, and actually try to
make something that i can and will use in my daily life.
